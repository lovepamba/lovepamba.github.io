*(work in progress)*

There will be people in my life that do not want to see me succeed. Unfortunately, some of these people are even my own family members. 

It is messed up when people outside of my family bet against me, but it is **fucked up** when my own flesh and blood would rather see me struggle.

What I have come to learn, is that when I lived a few months without these people and their rotten opinions clouding my life, I lived. *I lived.* I continued to prosper. 

There were moments where I felt emotionally hurt, and even felt physical pain in my heart and stomach. ***But I lived.***
