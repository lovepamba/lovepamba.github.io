*(work in progress)*

There will be people in your life that do not want to see you succeed. Unfortunately, these people may even be your own family members. 

It is messed up when people outside of your family bet against you, but it is **fucked up** when your own flesh and blood would rather see you struggle.

What I have come to learn, is that when I lived a few months without these people and their rotten opinions clouding my life, I lived. *I lived.* I continued to prosper. 

There were moments where I felt emotionally hurt, and even felt physical pain in my heart and stomach. ***But I lived.***
