There is always at least one person in a corporate setting who takes it upon his or herself to become the 'punk ass bitch' in your life on a daily basis.

My 'punk ass bitch' is the COO of my division. There is something extremely mentally unstable about a person who will go out of their way and waste time to avoid doing a requested task. It's a sad road for a managment "leader" who does not know how to lead without bias. In an effort to come across as a busy, authoritarian figure, this guy makes himself look stupid.

Instead of playing immature games, this fool needs to go balls to the wall and hit the floor running to smooth out operations. But he's a *dumbass fool*.

*Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me a third time, shame on the both of us*

I am no longer playing fool games. I am no longer providing the benefit of the doubt. This guy has shown his true colors.

*When a person shows you who they are, believe them.*

But what this motherfucker doesn't understand (or maybe he is slowly learning). *I am not the one.* I am older and have been emotionally harmed by my share of men. I know the game. To me, he is just another **fuckboy**. I crush fuckboy ambition for fun.
