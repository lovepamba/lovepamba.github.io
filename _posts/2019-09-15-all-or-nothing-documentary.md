I am currently watching a sports documentary about the Carolina Panthers called *All or Nothing*

What I am noticing is that as a player:

You can be the entertainer.
You can be the personality.
You can be the funny person.
You can be the 'just doing my job' person.

You will be hard pressed to be in charge even when you are one of the best talents.

Money equals power.
Ownership equals power.

Smiling and laughing all the time are signs of subordinance.

David Tepper is the owner of the Carolina Panthers.
He became a billionare through business and hedge fund management.
