I have attracted some of the most non-dependable, emotionally immature men into my life. Men that sell the relationship dream. Men that lie for seemingly no reason. 

Men that never cease to tell me that I am too independent. 

**Too independent??**

Independent because I find a way to get necessary things done when the man that was supposed to lead magically turns into a ghost?

Independent because a man will say that he will do a thing, but in most cases, it is done a day late and/or a dollar short?

Independent because I do not aspire to raise a boy who is at the ripe old age of what is considered a man?

**I try to let a man be a man**. But there is inevitable pride and ego that caressed the ears of men I've dealt with and that caress ever-so-soft caress always whispered "*Naw baby,* ***be difficult***".

Even with the smallest and most simple requests, pride and ego whispered "*Naw baby, be difficult*".

The brain provoked these men to *be difficult*. It could have all been so goddam easy.
