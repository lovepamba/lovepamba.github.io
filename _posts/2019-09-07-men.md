I have attracted some of the most non-dependable, emotionally immature men into my life. Men that sell the relationship dream. Men that lie for seemingly no reason. 

Men that never cease to tell me that I am too independent. 

**Too independent??**

Independent because I find a way to get necessary things done when the man that was supposed to lead magically turns into a ghost?

Independent because a man will say that he will do a thing, but in most cases, it is done a day late and/or a dollar short?

Independent because I do not aspire to raise a boy who is at the ripe old age of what is considered a man?

**I try** to let a man be a man. It is almost like there is inevitable pride and ego that caresses the ear of a man ever-so-softly and whispers *Naw baby,* ***be difficult***.

She just asked me to complete a reasonably easy request. Naw, *be difficult*.

What in the brain provokes a man to choose the *be difficult* route when it could all be so goddam easy?
