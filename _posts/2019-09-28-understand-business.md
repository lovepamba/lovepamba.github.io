Learning business concepts is similar to learning how to read as a child. It is important for me to take my time to let the business information settle into my brain. Read every word and understand it's use in the context of the writing. Doing this will allow me to build mind maps/models for information whereby I will be able to learn and implement teachings faster.

Another way I hope to truly learn business is to start an actual business. I aim to learn business in the trenches.

I am currently reading *Financial Planning & Analysis and Performance Management* by Jack Alexander.

## REVENUE
Revenue depends on external factors such as:

- CUSTOMER

- ECONOMIC FACTORS
