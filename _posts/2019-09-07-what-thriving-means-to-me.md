*(work in progress)*

Right now, I am surviving, and it is a decent survival. There are elements of uncertainty and areas of difficulty with people but also many rays of hope. 

In humanly fashion, I want more for my life because I want to realize my full potential. 

### Why I want to thrive
You only die once.
Take calculated risks.
Use fear as motivation.
Bring about positive change.

### What is thriving?
Having strong relationships with people.
Taking calculated risks and winning.
Knowing that you can readily generate income and be self-sufficient.
Knowing how to monetize your life.
