*You are not lighter than a paper bag so you probably wouldn't have made it...*

These were words spoken by my father directly to me. And for some strange reason he felt it ok to say these words to me - his daughter. He has said a lot of reckless shit to me over the years. 

My father puts white women on a pedestal. My father married a very light-skinned black woman for a reason. It was the 80s, and white was right while light-skin women reigned supreme in the community. Today light-skin women compete with "foreigns". 

Procreating with the opposite of what makes you feel ashamed about yourself does not mean your progeny will be born bearing none of the features you find less desirable.

I've had several boyfriends question or ridicule my skin color, my hair texture, or my facial features. Well, they can thank my father for them all; his plan did not pan out.


Also, it is no surprise that the women these ex-boyfriends decided to wife are light-skin or not black. And if the woman happens to be darker, it is because she has "good hair". This is 2019.

Men who "loved me" have nitpicked the hell out of my natural existence.
