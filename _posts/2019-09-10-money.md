Real talk, how do you become a person that is really, really good at making money?

It is a skill. 

I am really, really good at saving money. 

There are people that are really, really good at making money. They sell products and/or services. They create. Put the sellable out into the world and rake.

How?
Is marketing most important?
Is consistency most important?
Is their network most important?
Confidence?
Courage?
Persistence?

Maybe it is that they do not let perfectionism bog them down. These people are executers. They execute and shift/perfect their formulas along the way to be more appealing to the market.
