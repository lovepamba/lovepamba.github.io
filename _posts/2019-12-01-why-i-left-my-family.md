My parents are emotionally immature.
I do not feel good many times before, during, and after interacting with my immediate family. I usually feel horrible after interacting with them. I literally have to take time to re-calibrate and make sure my self-esteem is intact.

Many of my thoughts concerning future interactions with them are rooted in fantasy.
The reality of future interactions with my immediate family can be found in the way my mother and father are responding to me right now. 
- They admit no fault or participation in the matter. 
- They "put it all" on me because they lack emotional maturity 
	- (ie. the last text message from my father "MyName how's things going, haven't seen you in awhile. Would like for you to come down for Thanksgiving dinner". I am 99.9% certain that my mother forced my father to send that text.) 
	- AND (ie. the last text message from my mother "Happy Thanksgiving MyName. Hope you have a good meal somewhere today. Wish you were here. Love you". It sounds oh so sweet but my mother has yet to send a message where she says something like - I am sorry that we had that argument. **I know I played a part in our disagreement** and I want to make things better.)

There is a message of "hoping all is well" and a message of "haven't seen you in awhile". However, there has been no message of "**I know I played a part in our disagreement**". 


At this point, it is better for us to not interact. We do not need a relationship where we interact heavily; that is not mentally good for me.

I feel bad because I am removing the chance for the fantasy to manifest. But the keyword in that last statement was fantasy. I had a dream last night that I was promoted and my immediate family was there to celebrate me. That was a fantasy.


In the past, I would make decisions to continue to interact with my immediate family based on fantasy. I had a disconnect between fantasy and reality. This document is my connection of fantasy to reality.

Living in my own fantasy world had me feeling bad about setting boundaries with people that continue to elicit feelings of hurt and pain.
- It will have you thinking that you are missing out.
