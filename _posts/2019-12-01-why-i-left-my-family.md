My parents are emotionally immature.
I do not feel good many times before, during, and after interacting with my immediate family. I usually feel horrible after interacting with them. I literally have to take time to re-calibrate and make sure my self-esteem is intact.

Many of my thoughts concerning future interactions with them are rooted in fantasy.
The reality of future interactions with my immediate family can be found in the way my mother and father are responding to me right now. 
- They admit no fault or participation in the matter. 
- They "put it all" on me because they lack emotional maturity 
- - (ie. the last text message from my father "MyName how's things going, haven't seen you in awhile. Would like for you to come down for Thanksgiving dinner". I am 99.9% certain that my mother forced my father to send that text.) 
- - AND (ie. the last text message from my mother "Happy Thanksgiving MyName. Hope you have a good meal somewhere today. Wish you were here. Love you". It sounds oh so sweet but my mother has yet to send a message where she says something like - I am sorry that we had that argument. **I know I played a part in our disagreement** and I want to make things better.)

There is a message of "hoping all is well" and a message of "haven't seen you in awhile". However, there has been no message of "**I know I played a part in our disagreement**". 


At this point, it is better for us to not interact. We do not need a relationship where we interact heavily; that is not mentally good for me.
