My parents are emotionally immature.
I do not feel good many times before, during, and after interacting with my immediate family. I usually feel horrible after interacting with them. I literally have to take time to recalibrate and make sure my self-esteem is intact.

Many of my thoughts concerning future interactions with them are rooted in fantasy.
The reality of future interactions with my immediate family can be found in the way my mother and father are responding and not responding to me right now. 
- They admit no fault or participation in our disagreement. As a matter of fact, they do not mention the disagreement at all. 
- By not mentioning the disagreement, they "put it all" on me. This is another sign of a lack of emotional maturity. Examples of what they are saying when they contact me are: 
	- (ex. the last text message from my father "MyName how's things going, haven't seen you in awhile. Would like for you to come down for Thanksgiving dinner".) I am 99.9% certain that my mother forced my father to send that text. 
	- AND (ex. the last text message from my mother "Happy Thanksgiving MyName. Hope you have a good meal somewhere today. Wish you were here. Love you".) It sounds 'oh so sweet' but my mother has yet to send a message where she says something like - I am sorry that we had that argument. **I know I played a part in our disagreement** and I want to make things better.

There is a message of "hoping all is well" and a message of "haven't seen you in a while". However, there has been no message of "**I know I played a part in our disagreement**". 

At this point, it is better for us to not interact. We do not need a relationship where we interact heavily; that is not mentally good for me.

### Connecting the Fantasy to Reality
*In the past, I would make decisions to continue to interact with my immediate family based on fantasy. I carried a disconnect between fantasy and reality.*

**Fantasy** is thoughts and emotions that make me want to reach out and try to resolve the issues I have with my immediate family without the assistance of a therapist.

**Reality** is the present moment. It is me alone and okay. It is me fully understanding that my parents are still emotionally immature, and thus not ready to resolve any issues without it being a major detriment to my mental health.  

I feel bad at times because I am removing the chance for the fantasy to manifest. But the keyword in that last statement is fantasy. 

I had a dream last night that I was promoted at work, and my immediate family was there to celebrate me. That was fantasy.

Living in fantasy can have me feeling bad about setting boundaries with people that continue to elicit feelings of hurt and pain. It can have me thinking that I am missing out on necessary relationships.

The reality of the matter is that I am not missing out. I am being emotionally mature, and I am making the choice to protect my well-being. I accept that cutting off the fantasy is a bit painful. I will feel these emotions and keep moving forward. I must continue to parent and protect myself. If I do not do it, nobody else will.
