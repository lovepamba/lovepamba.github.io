Blessings:
- We are beautiful.
- We basically do not age.
- We are innately resourceful.
- We are the most resilient people on the planet.
- We are the most stylish people on the planet.

Curses:
- Everybody hates on us. 
- We get watched and followed in stores.
- We get our hair searched in airports.
- We have to deal with creepy old men (mostly white) like all the damn time.
- We tend to be the lowest paid employees. [Create: "Learn to be a bad bish and negotiate your worth"].


With that being said, here's a story. 

I get watched like a hawk when I go into retail stores - grocery stores, retail clothing stores, electronic stores, the mall, etc.

It is especially bad at Walmart and Kroger. 

So much so, I avoid shopping at Walmart or any Walmart affiliated store in-person. And I try to limit the amount of money I spend on Walmart.com on a monthly basis. 

I still have to get groceries so I suck it up and go to Kroger all the while wishing there were a black-owned grocery store nearby. *Shit, a black-owned everything nearby.* Is black-owned the solution though? 

Hell, I recently was heavily watched by a black woman employee and a black man security guard at Kroger. I know my fellow black folk were likely playing the uninformed, miseducated pawns in the systemic struggle that continues to oppress our people. However, black-owned is one solution from a collective economic, *Ujamaa* point of view. That read like a mighty, morphing Hotep so let me follow with this *No Hotep*.
