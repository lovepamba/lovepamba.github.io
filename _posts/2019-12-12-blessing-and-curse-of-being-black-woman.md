Blessings:
- We are beautiful.
- We basically do not age.
- We are innately resourceful.
- We are the most resilient people on the planet.
- We are the most stylish people on the planet.

Curses:
- Everybody hates on us. 
- We get watched and followed in stores.
- We get our hair searched in airports.
- We have to deal with creepy old men (mostly white) like all the damn time.
- We tend to be the lowest paid employees. [Create: "Learn to be a bad bish and negotiate your worth"].
