It is time for me to leave this town. It is time for me to continue to create the life I want to live.

I am currently wrapping my head around the fact that I am moving.

### Motivation to move
I am in the bedroom of my current apartment with no A/C. It is likely that the landlord turned the air conditioning unit off on purpose. I have lived in this apartment for two years and never had any troubles with the unit before I started withholding rent payments.

**Backstory:** I share a kitchen and living room wall with neighbors who violated the terms of the lease by having unauthorized pets in their home. As a result, a very *stank ass* animal odor began to overwhelm my apartment starting in June and still wafting present day. I have been withholding August rent and now September rent because my landlord is avoiding communication with me, and in turn, refuses to rectify the situation.
