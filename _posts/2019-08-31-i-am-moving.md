*(work in progress)*

It is time for me to continue to create the life I want to live. In the process, I am leaving this town. The cost of living is so reasonable here, but the prospect for higher paying jobs is not as reasonable.

I am currently wrapping my head around the fact that I am leaving - for a better job opportunity. And again let me note that I am moving for the chance to continue to create the life I want to live. 

I am excited to be moving. The only fear/worry that sits with me is that I am going to be spending more than twice my current rent for this new place. But I have to keep reminding myself that upward mobility is a thing, and it is my time to level up.

### Faith over fear
I have been struggling with my faith since I started my new job. I can affirm that faith played a huge role in me getting this job. Everything leading up to the job offer lowkey seemed too good to be true, but then again, upward mobility is still a thing. Now that I have the job, I am extremely afraid of losing it. This fear is all-consuming. Why am I so scared? (*not good enough thoughts rumble*) I know I'm scared but I have to keep my faith intact. For the most part, fear does not positively serve me.

Reality is usually never as bad as the mind thinks it will be. I have to keep this in mind. 

#### Sidenote: motivation to move
I am in the bedroom of my current apartment with no A/C. It is likely that the landlord turned the air conditioning unit off on purpose. I have lived in this apartment for two years and never had any troubles with the unit before I started withholding rent payments.

**Backstory:** I share a kitchen and living room wall with neighbors who violated the terms of the lease by having unauthorized pets in their home. As a result, a very *stank ass* animal odor began to overwhelm my apartment starting in June and still wafting present day. I have been withholding August rent and now September rent because my landlord is avoiding communication with me, and in turn, refuses to rectify the situation.
