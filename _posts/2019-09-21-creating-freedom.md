Most of the time I paper trade. I paper trade to understand what the market is offering. I've said it before; I will say it again. The market is very benevolent if you are mentally strong and patient enough to let it give to you. Withstand the fluctuations and swing with the market. 

I believe I will initially start swinging with $2k. 

I need money for modern day survival.

I have a job. Now I want to have a sole-proprietorship as well. I want to have a job and start to build muliple self-sufficient businesses.
