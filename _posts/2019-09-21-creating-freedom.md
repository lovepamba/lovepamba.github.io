Most of the time I paper trade. I paper trade to understand what the market is offering. I've said it before; I will say it again. The market is very benevolent if you are mentally strong and patient enough to let it give to you. I have got to withstand the fluctuations and swing with the market. 

I believe I will initially start swinging with $2k. 

I need money for modern day survival.

I have a job. Now I want to have a sole-proprietorship as well. I want to have a job and start to build muliple self-sufficient businesses.
