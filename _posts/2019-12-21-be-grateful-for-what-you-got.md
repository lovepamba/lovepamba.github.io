*(work in progress)*

Never get caught up in what I do not have in the present moment while I am rebuilding my life.

- I may not have a sound family unit.
- I may not have good, solid friendships.
- I may find myself alone most of the time.

But I am a good person. I still have my life, and therefore, I have the chance to continue to create a life that fills me up rather than drains me.

"*But remember brothers and sisters, You can still stand tall, Just be thankful for what you got.*" - William DeVaughn
