*(work in progress)*

Never get caught up in what you do not have in the moment while you are rebuilding your life.

- You may not have a sound family unit.
- You may not have good, solid friendships.
- You may find yourself alone most of the time.

But you still have your life, and therefore, you have the chance to continue to create a life that fills your rather than drains you.

*But remember brothers and sisters, You can still stand tall, Just be thankful for what you got.* - William DeVaughn
