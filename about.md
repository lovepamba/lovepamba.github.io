#### The Bad Season
I know firsthand what is feels like to be living a life but wishing for death. I recently emerged from a decade plus of life where I was progressively unable to realize my true potential because I was unknowingly suffering from dsythmia along with PMDD. I credit therapy/counseling, my mother's presence, and faith & hope for getting me through. It was a tough time plagued with so many lows that currently I push myself to monitor my well-being very closely as well as seek healthy solutions daily due to fear of ever having to feel so hopeless again. Currently, I knowingly combat dsythmia and PMDD. I would not wish the struggle of dsythmia or PMDD on my worst enemy. And believe me there are some *gran puntas* that have and continue to grace my path.

#### The Good/Better Season
*I am in a good season.*

Generally now, I am a pretty happy and content person. I don't have periods where I completely shutdown overwhelmed by depression anymore. I cite history and stay knowledgeable about current events. I have and continue to gain necessary skills for modern survival. I work a corporate job that provides a very decent salary (I say that from the viewpoint of being African-American and a woman). And at this point, I feel like I am being paid fairly. *I will let you know if that changes*.

I love to create. I am fascinated with coding. There are so many free or low-cost resources that allow us to build - possibly something great that resonates with others.

This is my journey from **better to best**.
