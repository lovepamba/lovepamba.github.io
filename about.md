#### The Bad Season
I know the firsthand what is feels like to be living a life but wishing for death. I recently emerged from a decade of life where I was not able to live my true potential because I was unknowingly suffering from dsythmia along with PMDD. Currently, I knowingly deal with dsythmia and PMDD. I would not wish the struggle of dsythmia or PMDD on my worst enemy. And believe me there are some *gran puntas* that have graced my path.

#### The Better Season
Generally, I am a pretty happy and content person. I am aware of history and stay knowledgeable about current events. I have and continue to gain necessary skills for modern survival. I work a corporate job that provides a very decent salary (I say that from the viewpoint of being African-American and a woman). And at this point, I feel like I am being paid fairly. *I will let you know if that changes*.

I am in a good season of my life.

I love to create. I am fascinated with coding. There are so many free or low-cost resources that allow us to build - possibly something great that resonates with others.

This is my journey from **better to best**.
