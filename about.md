Generally, I am a pretty happy and content person. I am aware of history and stay knowledgeable about current events. I have and continue to gain necessary skills for modern survival. I work a corporate job that provides a very decent salary (I say that from the viewpoint of being African-American and a woman). At this point, I feel like I am being paid fairly. *I will let you know if that changes*.

Personally, I know the firsthand what is feels like to be living a troubled life. I literally just emerged from a decade of my life where I was not able to live my true potential because I was unknowingly suffering from dsythmia along with PMDD. Currently, I knowingly deal with dsythmia and PMDD.

I love to create. I am fascinated with coding. There are so many free or low-cost resources that allow us to build - possibly something great that resonates with others.

This is my journey from **better to best**.
